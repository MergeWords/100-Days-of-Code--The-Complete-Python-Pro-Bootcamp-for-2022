# Exercise 3 - Life in Weeks
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
# https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years = 90
age_minus_years = 90 - int(age)
# print(f"You have {age_minus_years} years")
days_left = age_minus_years * 365

# print(f"{days_left}, ")
